# Start Machine Learning in 2025 - Become an expert for free!

## A complete guide to start and improve in machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) in 2025 without ANY background in the field and stay up-to-date with the latest news and state-of-the-art techniques!

This guide is intended for anyone having zero or a small background in programming, maths, and machine learning. There is no specific order to follow, but a classic path would be from top to bottom. If you don't like reading books, skip it, if you don't want to follow an online course, you can skip it as well. There is not a single way to become a machine learning expert and with motivation, you can absolutely achieve it.

All resources listed here are free, except some online courses and books, which are certainly recommended for a better understanding, but it is definitely possible to become an expert without them, with a little more time spent on online readings, videos and practice. When it comes to paying courses, the links in this guide are affiliated links. Please, use them if you feel like following a course as it will support me. Thank you, and have fun learning! Remember, this is completely up to you and not necessary. I felt like it was useful to me and maybe useful to others as well.

Don't be afraid to repeat videos or learn from multiple sources. Repetition is the key of success to learning!

## Start with short YouTube video introductions<a name="youtubevideos"></a>
### Start with short YouTube videos introductions
This is the best way to start from nothing in my opinion. Here, I list a few of the best videos I found that will give you a great first introduction of the terms you need to know to get started in the field.

* Introduction to the most used terms
    * [Learn the basics in a minute - Louis Bouchard](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO4GrDnQanVe6F6MRJg_KO7JEoH-ukFzY) - YouTube Playlist
    
* Understand the neural networks
    * [Neural Networks Demystified - Welch Labs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU) - YouTube Playlist
    * [Learn Neural Networks - 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) - YouTube Playlist

* Understanding Transformers and LLMs (i.e. models behind ChatGPT)!
   * Luis Serrano, "[Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs8w1Cdi-zvYskDS2icIItfZgxclApVLv)" - amazing video introductions to the attention mechanism, tokens, embeddings and more to better understand everything behind large language models like GPT!
   * Louis Bouchard's LLM free course videos "[Train & Fine-Tune LLMs for Production Course by Activeloop, Towards AI & Intel Disruptor](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO4GrDnQanVcPlQUBuMd_pwRkILfc463G&si=QbXeHeDs5RSKH3nY)". "A playlist for our LLM course: Gen AI 360: Foundational Model Certification!"

Another easy **way to get started and keep learning is by listening to podcasts** in your spare time. Driving to work, on the bus, or having trouble falling asleep? Listen to some AI podcasts to get used to the terms and patterns, and learn about the field through inspiring stories! I invite you to follow a few of the best I personally prefer, like [Lex Fridman](https://open.spotify.com/show/2MAi0BvDc6GTFvKFPXnkCL), [Machine Learning Street Talk](https://open.spotify.com/show/02e6PZeIOdpmBGT9THuzwR), [Latent Space Podcast](https://www.latent.space/podcast), and obviously, my podcast: [Louis Bouchard Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/4rKRJXaXlClkDyInjHkxq3), where you will learn about incredibly talented people in the field with inspiring stories sharing the knowledge they worked so hard to gather.

## No math background for ML? Check this out!<a name="math"></a>
### No math background for ML? Check this out!
Don't stress, just like most of the things in life, you can learn maths! Here are some great beginner and advanced resources to get into machine learning maths. I would suggest starting with these three very important concepts in machine learning (here are 3 awesome free courses available on Khan Academy):

* [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) - Khan Academy
* [Statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) - Khan Academy
* [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) - Khan Academy

Here are some great free books and videos that might help you learn in a more "structured approach":

* [mathematicalmonk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAtD_VYwcYwVbTdvArsm7w) - YouTube
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://gwthomas.github.io/docs/math4ml.pdf) - Garrett Thomas
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics)](http://fs2.american.edu/alberto/www/analytics/ISLRLectures.html) - Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani

If you still lack mathematical confidence, check out the [Read books](#ReadBooks) section above, where I shared many great books to build a strong mathematical background.
You now have a very good math background for machine learning and you are ready to dive in deeper!


## No coding background, no problem<a name="coding"></a>
### No coding background, no problem
Here is a list of some great courses to learn the programming side of machine learning.

Here, I want to quickly mention that we recently released our new course, "Python for Generative AI" where we focus on teaching Python programming "as a tool" for working with AI systems. If your goal is to do that and not learn programming for the sake of programming, check it out [on the Towards AI Academy](https://academy.towardsai.net/courses/python-for-genai/?ref=1f9b29).

## Practice, practice, and practice!<a name="practice"></a>
### Practice is key

The most important thing in programming is practice. And this applies to machine learning too. It can be hard to find a personal project to practice.

Fortunately, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) exists. This website is full of free courses, tutorials and competitions. You can join competitions for free and just download their data, read about their problem and start coding and testing right away! You can even earn money from winning competitions and it is a great thing to have on your resume. This may be the best way to get experience while learning a lot and even earn money! Another great opportunity for projects is to follow courses that are oriented towards a specific application like the [AI For trading course from Udacity](https://imp.i115008.net/Rymvkg).

You can also create teams for kaggle competition and learn with people! I suggest you join a community to find a team and learn with others, it is always better than alone. Check out the next section for that.


## Want to build language models/apps? Check this out (Now with LLMs!)!<a name="nlp"></a>
I had a lot of requests from people wanting to focus on natural language processing (NLP) (models dealing with language) or even learn machine learning strictly for NLP tasks. This is a section dedicated to that need. Happy NLP learning!
