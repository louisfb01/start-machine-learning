# Start Machine Learning in 2023 - Become an expert for free!

## A complete guide to start and improve in machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) in 2023 without ANY background in the field and stay up-to-date with the latest news and state-of-the-art techniques!

This guide is intended for anyone having zero or a small background in programming, maths, and machine learning. There is no specific order to follow, but a classic path would be from top to bottom. If you don't like reading books, skip it, if you don't want to follow an online course, you can skip it as well. There is not a single way to become a machine learning expert and with motivation, you can absolutely achieve it.

All resources listed here are free, except some online courses and books, which are certainly recommended for a better understanding, but it is definitely possible to become an expert without them, with a little more time spent on online readings, videos and practice. When it comes to paying courses, the links in this guide are affiliated links. Please, use them if you feel like following a course as it will support me. Thank you, and have fun learning! Remember, this is completely up to you and not necessary. I felt like it was useful to me and maybe useful to others as well.

Don't be afraid to repeat videos or learn from multiple sources. Repetition is the key of success to learning!

## Start with short YouTube video introductions<a name="youtubevideos"></a>
### Start with short YouTube videos introductions
This is the best way to start from nothing in my opinion. Here, I list a few of the best videos I found that will give you a great first introduction of the terms you need to know to get started in the field.

* Introduction to the most used terms

### No math background for ML? Check this out!
Don't stress, just like most of the things in life, you can learn maths! Here are some great beginner and advanced resources to get into machine learning maths. I would suggest starting with these three very important concepts in machine learning (here are 3 awesome free courses available on Khan Academy):

* [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) - Khan Academy
* [Statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) - Khan Academy
* [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) - Khan Academy

Here are some great free books and videos that might help you learn in a more "structured approach":

## Practice, practice, and practice!<a name="practice"></a>
### Practice is key

The most important thing in programming is practice. And this applies to machine learning too. It can be hard to find a personal project to practice.

Fortunately, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) exists. This website is full of free courses, tutorials and competitions. You can join competitions for free and just download their data, read about their problem and start coding and testing right away! You can even earn money from winning competitions and it is a great thing to have on your resume. This may be the best way to get experience while learning a lot and even earn money! Another great opportunity for projects is to follow courses that are oriented towards a specific application like the [AI For trading course from Udacity](https://imp.i115008.net/Rymvkg).

You can also create teams for kaggle competition and learn with people! I suggest you join a community to find a team and learn with others, it is always better than alone. Check out the next section for that.


## Want to build language models/apps? Check this out!<a name="nlp"></a>
I had a lot of requests from people wanting to focus on natural language processing (NLP) (models dealing with language) or even learn machine learning strictly for NLP tasks. This is a section dedicated to that need. Happy NLP learning!
* [A complete roadmap to master NLP in 2022](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/01/roadmap-to-master-nlp-in-2022/)

* [An NLP Nano Degree!](https://imp.i115008.net/jW4K60) — Paid
_"Learn cutting-edge natural language processing techniques to process speech and analyze text. Build probabilistic and deep learning models, such as hidden Markov models and recurrent neural networks, to teach the computer to do tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and more!"_
* NLTK Book is the free resource to learn about fundamental theories behind NLP: https://www.nltk.org/book/
* Looking to build a quick text classification model or word vectorizer, [fasttext](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/supervised-tutorial.html) is a good library to quickly train up a model.
* [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1) is THE place to get modern day NLP models, and they also include a whole [course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1) about it.
* [SpaCy](https://course.spacy.io/en/) is great for NLP in production, as it does NLU, NER, and one can train classification, etc with it. It's also able to add customized steps or models into the pipeline.
* [Prompting!](https://learnprompting.org/) Prompting is a new skill that you should master if you want to build NLP-related apps. This is a great course I am contributing to, intending to teach prompting and give tips for specific models.
